print("ðŸ’¡ Topic 1 ðŸ’¡\nCreating Structs\n")
// Structs are a very powerful tool in Swift because they allow us to create our own complex data types.
// They even allow for their own custom variables and funcntions

// Here's a basic struct
struct VideoGame {
    let genre: String
    let title: String
    let developer: String
    let releaseDate: String
    
    func displayGame() {
        print("Game: \(title)\nGenre: \(genre)\nDeveloper: \(developer)\nRelease Date: \(releaseDate)")
        
    }
}

// lets look at how we would create an object that is an instance of our new VideoGame struct
let re4Remake = VideoGame(genre: "Horror", title: "Resident Evil 4 Remake", developer:"Capcom", releaseDate: "03/23/23")

// we can access each of the properties that we gave to the Videogame type with a dot ".":
print(re4Remake.genre) // prints "Horror"
print(re4Remake.title) // prints "Resident Evil 4 Remake"
print(re4Remake.developer) // prints "Capcom"
print(re4Remake.releaseDate) // prints "3/23/23"


// we can think of an object/instance as a real world struct, which we can actually use --- like calling displayGame to get the link
re4Remake.displayGame() // prints "Game: Resident Evil 4 Remake\nGenre: Horror\nDeveloper: Capcom\nRelease Date: 3/23/23"

print("ðŸ’¡ Topic 2 ðŸ’¡\nWorking with Properties\n")

// Creating a property is simple in Swift Structs, just define whether it is mutatable or not, and define the type

struct Battery {
    var maxBatteryMinutes: Int = 300 // adding an equals adds a default value, but if you want to change it, it has to be mutable
    var currentBatteryPercentage: Int
}

var iPhoneBattery = Battery(maxBatteryMinutes: 50, currentBatteryPercentage: 100)
// static properties can only be accessed
print(iPhoneBattery.maxBatteryMinutes) // prints 50
// trying to change it will throw an error
// iPhoneBattery.maxBatteryMinutes = 100 <-- will throw error: Cannot assign to property: 'maxBatteryMinutes' is a 'let' constant
// but you can both access and change currentBatteryPercentage:
print(iPhoneBattery.currentBatteryPercentage) // prints 100

// changing currentBatteryPercentage:
iPhoneBattery.currentBatteryPercentage = 25
print(iPhoneBattery.currentBatteryPercentage) // prints 25

// methods of a struct that read data dont need anything, but methods that change properties of a struct need to be marked with the keyword mutating:
struct Inventory {
    let inventorySize: Int
    var inventoryItems: [String: Int] = [:]

    // doesn't need mutating keyword (only reading a property)
    func readItems(){
        print(inventoryItems)
    }
    
    // needs mutating keyword (is writing to property)
    mutating func addItem(item: String, amount: Int){
        inventoryItems[item] = amount
    }
}

var minecraftInventory = Inventory(inventorySize: 36)

minecraftInventory.readItems() // prints []
minecraftInventory.addItem(item: "Diamond Sword", amount: 1)
minecraftInventory.addItem(item: "Steak", amount: 64)
minecraftInventory.readItems() // prints ["Diamond Sword" : 1, "Steak": 64]

    var age: Int {

print("ðŸ’¡ Topic 3 ðŸ’¡\nWorking with Initializers\n")

// Even though every struct has an initializer, Swift silently creates one so we don't have to do the work ourselves

    var ranking: Int

print("ðŸ’¡ Topic 4 ðŸ’¡\nAccess Controll\n")

// Swift lets us access the properties of a struct freely, but many times that isn't what we want. Here is where access controll comes in.
// You can define a property as private, which will not allow it to be accessed directly

struct Server {

    var publicFiles: Array<String> // but the public files don't have to be private, because we don't care about them as much

// if you made an instance of HersheysFactory
//var factory1 = HersheysFactory()
